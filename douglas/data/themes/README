README - themes
===============

The themes directory holds the themes your blog can be rendered in. By
default this is the "html" and "rss" themes. These themes are rendered
using Jinja2.

Static assets for a theme go in the theme's "static/" directory. In
order to avoid stomping on other static files, use the theme name as a
namespace.

For example::

    themes/
        html/
            static/
                html/
                    sunflower.jpg
                    style.css
                    navigation.js
                    right-arrow.png
