README - Drafts
===============

This is your drafts directory for any entries you're in the process of
writing but haven't finished, yet.


When you're ready to publish an entry, move it from the drafts directory
to your entries directory.

Anything in the drafts directory is rendered, but won't show up in
entry lists except on the drafts page. You can see the drafts page by
going to the url of your blog plus ``drafts/``. This makes it easier for
other people to proofread your entries before they go live.
