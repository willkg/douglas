README - Plugins
================

Douglas lets you use plugins to augment the default behavior. This makes
it a lot easier to make your blog do what you need it to do.

Douglas comes with a core set of plugins. These plugins are all in the
Douglas code--they aren't in this directory.

This directory is for plugins that are't part of Douglas that you either
wrote yourself or got from someone else.
