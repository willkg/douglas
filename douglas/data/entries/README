README - Entries
================

The files for your blog entries go in this directory. Each subdirectory of
this directory is a "category". This allows you to create a tree of files
that matches the category hierarchy of your blog.

Each entry is in a format something like this::

    Title of entry
    #metadata
    <p>
      Body of the entry.
    </p>

Metadata lets you specify things in your entries that affect plugins and
rendering.

The body of your entry can be in HTML using the blosxom_entry_parser,
reStructuredText using the rst_parser, or any other format you like as long
as there's an entry parser for it.

For information on writing entries and entry parsers, see the documentation.
