README - Pages
==============

Pages are parts of your blog that aren't date-sensitive. For example, you
could have an "About this blog" page.

Pages files are structured the same as entries. The only major differences
are that they exist in the pages/ directory and not the entries/ directory
and that when rendered, pages use the ``page`` template and not the
``entry`` template.

See the documentation for more details.
